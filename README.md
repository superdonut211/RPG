For my game project, I'm going to use three design patterns to make things work better. 
First, I'll use Singleton to keep all my game settings in one place so they're easy to change. 
Then, I'll use Factory Method to make different parts of the game, like enemies, without getting 
everything mixed up. Lastly, Observer will help parts of the game talk to each other when stuff 
happens, like scoring points or moving levels. This should make my game easier to handle and more fun.
